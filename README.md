# Let's Draw Together!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is where you and your friends can doodle on the same canvas at the same time.

## What's cool about it?

- You can draw with friends in real-time (no refreshing needed!)
- Everyone gets their own color so you know who drew what
- You can see who's currently drawing
- Anyone can clear the canvas when you want to start fresh
- It's oddly satisfying to watch others draw in real-time

## Under the hood

I built this using:

- JavaScript (no fancy frameworks on the frontend)
- RxJS for handling all the mouse events
- Node.js and Express for the backend
- Socket.io for the real-time magic
- HTML5 Canvas for the actual drawing part

## How it actually works

When you draw something:

1. Your mouse movements get captured as streams of events
2. The app connects the dots between where your mouse was and where it is now
3. Your drawing gets sent to the server
4. The server tells everyone else connected
5. Their screens update with your contribution

## Want to try it out?

### You'll need:

- Node.js installed (anything newer than v12)
- npm or yarn

### Getting it running:

1. Grab the code:

   ```
   git clone -
   cd collaborative-drawing-app
   ```

2. Install the stuff it needs:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Fire it up:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open up your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
